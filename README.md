# Comparing-PPI-networks-of-SARS-CoV-2-and-H1N1-influenza
 This code is related to our recently proposed method for:
- Studying SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs to investigate similarities and differences between them.
- Examining complex network properties such as graph density, degree distribution, and 21 different centrality measures.
- Fitting power law and exponential distributions.
- Dimensionality reduction and Applying unsupervised learning methods to reveal appropriate centrality measures.
